= Résumé

*Source content and build scripts for my curriculum vitae (CV), compiled from LaTeX.*

== Documentation

=== Requirements

Before running the build scripts, install and start *Docker Desktop*.

On Windows, it is RECOMMENDED to configure Docker to use WSL 2, and then run the build commands from WSL in a terminal running under administrator mode. Linux emulators like Git Bash are not sufficient.

Make sure each of the `run/*` scripts are executable:

[source,sh]
----
chmod +x run/*
----

=== Starting

To start the Docker container, run:

[source,sh]
----
./run/start
----

=== Building

=== Stopping

To stop the Docker container, run:

[source,sh]
----
./run/stop
----
